Maybe if she trilled right-wing incels earlier celibate change would have been fixed by now."

I already had a lot of respect for this girl when she laid into world leaders about climate change, and it just went up. 

She hurt his fragile fee-fees so much he got himself arrested because he couldn’t cope with the fact that a “little girl” spat hot fire at him, and it actually burned."

1672349016,2022-12-29 21:23:36,news,j25r0uu,"If a belief is centered around emotional attachments in the form of core beliefs and/or group belonging, logic has *no* say in it. 

Feeling dictate decisions far more than thinking ever does. Where people land tend to be at the mercy of coincidence, which group they fell in with by birth or socialization. If you are lucky you end up on the side science agrees with.

Half a century of military funded studies into how to convince people and change their minds went nowhere until someone figured out that the only reliable way to change someone opinion is to change how they feel about the issue first. 

And the more people care about an issue, the more feelings rule over the matter. 

In these cases the intellect instead becomes weaponized. They use it to reason their way towards the answer they want. Which is fairly standard practice for humanity. We get a lot of practice doing this in our daily life on various scales and subjects. 

We also do this for moral matters. I think there was a study they might have called ""are the shoes cute?"" which showed that people who ahead of the experiment said they were very concerned about ethical practices, workers rights and environmentalism would actively avoid information about a product they liked and wanted for themselves. They avoided it because they did not want to find out negative information and be forced to choose between the product and their moral sense. 

This explains quite a lot about human history. 

There are also people who are smart in one particular way that gets categorized as intellectual by society, and might get an inflated sense of what their abilities outside their expertise is. That for example an engineering degree can somehow equal or supersede a doctorate degree in climate science. 

And some who have completed degrees did so by regurgitating information and textbook answers, and may not themselves be that sharp with things that require deeper thinking. While also confusing this type of ability for general high intelligence. Or wisdom."

1672343981,2022-12-29 19:59:41,news,j25e5ik,"As a geologist, ""I'm an Engineer and... "" has been a classic opening to climate-change-denial BS for decades. 

Engineers are experts in very specific fields but, even more-so than a chemist or biologist or any other ""science type"" often have educations hyper-focused on that specific field that neglect broader critical thinking and argumentation skills. The majority are smart enough to recognise their own limitations but enough fall into ""I'm an expert in all-things-science"" that it becomes a common issue."
